This application visualises the spread of a message through Twitter's social network and analyses the tweet's happiness. Based on this application, collected Twitter data can be analysed towards the relation between a tweet's sentiment and its reach. The ultimate goal of this research project is to show whether good or bad news travels faster (and farther) in a social network.

In order to deploy and run the application, die Consumer and Access Key/Token have to be filled in in the /resources/config.properties file.
